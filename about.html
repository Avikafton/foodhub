                        FoodHub began as a small idea in a kitchen — a place where friends shared recipes and stories
                        over home-cooked meals. What started as a local passion project has grown into a global
                        community of food lovers, creators, and everyday chefs who believe that cooking brings people
                        closer together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our journey continues as we help more people rediscover the joy of cooking, one recipe at a
                        time. We’re dedicated to providing inspiring, reliable, and delicious content that empowers
                        everyone to create and share food with heart.
